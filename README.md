# SimpleAst

A port of [discordapp/simpleast](https://github.com/discordapp/SimpleAST) to Rust.

A library to create simple ast parsers using regex based rules.

Currently mostly limited to Discord-flavored markdown, intended for use in
[discord clients](https://github.com/terminal-discord/weechat-discord)
