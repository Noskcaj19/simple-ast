# SimpleAst

A port of [discordapp/simpleast](https://github.com/discordapp/SimpleAST) to Rust.

A library to create simple ast parsers using regex based rules.

Originally for Discord-flavored markdown, intended for use in
[discord clients](https://github.com/terminal-discord/weechat-discord)

The api is generic and should allow custom ast types and rules.
